## üî≠ Notable Projects

### [Haiku Reels](https://github.com/joackob/haiku-reels-astro)

Haiku Reels is a website dedicated to sharing and preserving students' creativity through haikus. These short Japanese poems capture moments, emotions, or nature's beauty in three lines.

Part of a long-standing school initiative, students create haikus as part of their learning and artistic expression. The platform allows exploration of these poems by author, date, year, school, and class, tracking each generation's poetic development. Built with modern technologies and mobile-optimized, it provides a clean environment to focus on the haikus.

Linked to the Borges Foundation, an organization promoting art and culture in education, the project has grown and extended to the community. Visit the Borges Foundation to learn more.

This space is a platform for haikus and a living archive of the collective effort to promote poetry and art in education.
